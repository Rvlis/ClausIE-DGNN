# DGnnIE: Dependency Graph Neural Network based Open Information Extraction

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 18.04
- python>=3.7
- pytorch>=1.6
- [torchtext](https://pypi.org/project/torchtext/)
- graph4nlp
- [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html) for dependnecy parsing

## Dataset
- Training set is from __imojie__, the original set can download from [here](https://github.com/dair-iitd/imojie) by running __download_data.sh__ 
1. Training set:
    By running
    ```
    python process_imojie_train_dataset.py
    ```
    you can get `train_1w.json`, `train_3w.json` and `train_9w.json` in `/raw` folder

2. Val and test set is placed in `/raw` folder named as `val.json` and `test.json`, they are from [CaRB](https://github.com/dair-iitd/CaRB)
    
    âš  Noting that because DGnnIE only considers binary extraction, the `val` and `test` are processed by filtering out n-ary extractions, running
    ```python
    python process_carb_val_and_test_dataset.py
    ``` 

## Train model
```bash
bash train.sh
```

## Inference
```bash
bash inference.sh
```
with `single input` and `batch input`

## Performance
1. [Training log](./out/gcn_bi_sep_l2_ckpt/metric.log)
    - with BLEU score `BLEU_1 = 0.64975, BLEU_2 = 0.59110, BLEU_3 = 0.53981, BLEU_4 = 0.49458`

2. [Performance on CaRB](./out/gcn_bi_sep_l2_ckpt/carb.log)
